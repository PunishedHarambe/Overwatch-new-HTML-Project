<p><b><small><strong>The game itself is set 60 years in the future, but the story really starts a mere
 30 years down the road. It’s a future brimming with technological advancements, 
 teleportation technology, flying cars, laser guns, and clear steps forward in robotics. 
 Mankind developed artificial intelligence, real artificial intelligence, creating sentient 
 robots for the purpose of bolstering manufacturing and creating economic equality worldwide. 
 These robots, called omnics, and their facilities, called omniums, were incredibly common all
 over the world. People existed side by side with omnics, and while it wasn’t exactly utopia, it was peaceful.</strong></small></b><p>

<p><h2><i>A Broken Peace</i></h2><p>

<p><b><small><strong>Unfortunately, that peace didn’t last. For some reason, the ominums went 
rogue, and began churning out armies of militarized omnics that promptly began a 
global effort to overthrow the human race. Uprisings sprouted up all over the world, 
because the omniums themselves were scattered all over the world. And despite 
mankind’s technological prowess, there was very little the individual nations 
of the world could do against such a large scale threat. Understandable, 
considering the omnics likely had access to every piece of technology the human race had.</strong></small></b><p>

<p><h3><i>The Comeback</i></h3></p>

<p><b><small><strong>Desperate to fight back, the United Nations came together to try and find
 some kind of solution. Gabrielle Adawe, secretary-general of the UN, formed a 
 team of the world’s best soldiers and best technology, creating an elite strike 
 unit that was hopefully capable of bringing down the threat. This team, called
 Overwatch, was filled with soldiers from all over the world. The appointed 
 leader was a military veteran and member of the soldier enhancement program a
 man from Los Angeles named Gabriel Reyes. His second was another member of the
 same soldier enhancement program and a close friend: John “Jack” Morrison.</strong></small></b><p>
